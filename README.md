# 🖼 carbon-image-api

## 📃 Description:
An unofficial API for capturing beautiful screenshots of your source code from carbon.now.sh.

Using Puppeteer, it navigates to the [carbon.now.sh](https://www.carbon.now.sh) website using a constructed url based on the JSON body sent to the server. Based on the 
route used, the image of the code is sent back as an image or as a link, where it is stored in Cloudinary.
